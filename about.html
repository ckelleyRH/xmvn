<h2><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>XMvn is a set of free software components that are useful in packaging Java software whose build is managed by Apache Maven. XMvn maintains a system-wide repository of artifacts, which it uses to build projects without having to connect to the Internet to download artifacts from remote Maven repositories, such as Maven Central. XMvn also provides plugins for Apache Maven that can help with creating and debugging RPM packages containing Maven artifacts. XMvn name is derived from &quot;local eXtensions for MaVeN&quot;.</p></section><section>
<h2><a name="Reasons_for_existence_of_XMvn"></a>Reasons for existence of XMvn</h2>
<p>According to one of Moore's laws, the volume of computer software grows exponentially with time. This is reflected in a fast increase of the number of packages in GNU/Linux distributions. Unfortunately the number of contributors doesn't grow as fast. There is a clear need for better tooling so that package maintainers can keep up with fast changes in the free software world.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Java packagers a current trend in Java build systems is Apache Maven, which, as opposed to Apache Ant, is based on the project object model (POM). The model is stored in standardized XML form in <code>pom.xml</code> files. This form of managing project configuration opens the door for improvements in packaging of Maven artifacts in GNU/Linux distributions.</p>
<p>Most of information that need to be included in every RPM package is already present in a Maven POM. This includes simple things like name, description or licensing, but also complex things such as dependencies, which are even more powerful than RPM dependencies (think of dependency scopes or exclusions).</p>
<p>Metadata redundancy creates a need for constantly synchronizing POM metadata with RPM metadata with every package update. Outdated package description may be quite harmless, but incorrect dependencies can result in severe packaging bugs. Synchronizing dependencies is very important, but tedious at the same time, which unfortunately makes many packagers update dependencies carelessly or even skip this step completely. Inaccurate RPM requires can cause installation of hundreds of unneeded packages, but it can also (more importantly) break of other packages.</p>
<p>The <code>%install</code> section of RPM spec files is another example of redundant data. Traditionally each JAR or POM file would need to be explicitly listed there, which wasn't as error-prone as listing dependencies, but still a tedious task, which could be easily automated.</p>
<p>Similar techniques are already in use. Fedora has automatic requires generator for Perl packages, there is also a tool for generation of spec files. Shared libraries have automatic requires generation in all major Linux distributions. These techniques have not yet been widely adopted for Java packages, possibly because free Java was available much later than other major programming languages used in GNU/Linux.</p>
<p>Keeping RPM and upstream metadata in sync was the main reason for creating XMvn.</p></section><section>
<h2><a name="Pros"></a>Pros</h2>
<p>XMvn offers significant advantages over the traditional ways of packaging Java, especially in RPM-based distributions, such as improved dependency management, faster updates or easy subpackage creation.</p>
<p>Packages that are using XMvn to build are simpler and more readable. This allows developers to maintain much more packages that they would interesting or important tasks.</p>
<p>The simplicity of packages using XMvn allows more people to contribute to Java packaging. Maintenance of Maven packages no longer requires deep knowledge of packaging guidelines and handling corner cases. Only developers maintaining more complicated packages need to know mode advanced aspects of packaging Java using XMvn.</p>
<p>Packages using XMvn can be updated much faster than traditional Java packages. Often just version bump is enough. This is because most of package metadata as well as <code>%build</code> and <code>%install</code> sections are maintained by XMvn so there is no need to change them manually.</p>
<p>Using XMvn will usually result in a quality improvement. One of reasons for that is automated dependency management, which when done manually was the source of many packaging bugs. Improved quality is also an indirect consequence of more readable spec files (bugs are easier to notice).</p>
<p>Metadata redundancy is reduced in XMVn packages. This means that if someone wants to update some package information this can be done in a single place. </p>
<p>Maintenance of multi-module packages is much easier with XMvn, almost as easy as single-module packages. &quot;One artifact per package&quot; rule is closer to upstream packaging, improves granularity of packaging, dependency graphs are more accurate.</p>
<p>The existence of XMvn allows upstream Maven to be used without any patching. To build packages with Maven a custom patch set had to be maintained and rebased with each update of Maven. XMvn obsoletes that custom patches and allows Maven to be included in a distribution unmodified.</p>
<p>Lastly, a very important advantage: changes in distribution policy are much easier to implement as there is only one place to implement the changes - XMvn configuration. With traditional way of packaging any change in packaging policy requires all affected packages to be modified, which often was a difficult task.</p></section><section>
<h2><a name="Cons"></a>Cons</h2>
<p>As you may expect, these advantages comes at a price. In XMvn's case, there are several tradeoffs that have been made in order to allow its function. One of the greatest targets of complaints is the lack of packager's control over what is happening behind the scenes. This is a valid concern, but every simplification is accompanied by a loss of control. To accommodate for this fact, XMvn does not prevent the packager from adhering to the existing packaging customs, henceforth leaving control in hands of those who require it.</p>
<p>In cases where a packaging bug occurs, using XMvn may under certain circumstances make debugging more difficult compared to the traditional way of Java packaging. However, since most packages use a rather standard way of packaging, in most cases no serious hardships are expected, especially after the initial bugs are ironed out.</p>
<p>Even though XMvn allows the traditional way of packaging, it is not always compatible with some older systems (to name a few: RHEL 5, RHEL 6, Fedora 18 and older). In theory, this fact makes packager's work harder by forcing him to keep two versions of the same package, but since the updating policy of the affected systems allows only security patches or the systems are beyond their projected life time, we do not consider this a show stopper.</p></section><section>
<h2><a name="Future"></a>Future</h2>
<p>Even though many hardships while packaging Java projects have already been addressed by XMvn, many other are still untackled as of today. In the near future, we expect XMvn to be able to completely generate <code>*.spec</code> files from POM files. While this might sound as too daring an endeavor, most of the necessary data is already contained in POMs (name, version, license, build dependencies, runtime dependencies, URI of the project, SCM location, modules etc.). Of course, the ability to generate the spec file automatically doesn't mean that the package maintainer may just run XMvn and file a package review request; while most of the simple work will be automated, checking the resulting file, verifying the content's accuracy or license information still remains completely a responsibility of the maintainer.</p>
<p>As other likely features go, XMvn might not remain strictly a command line-based tool. Either a graphical interface or integration with some Java IDE seem as valuable extension of the current program.</p></section>
