<h2><a name="Release_notes_for_XMvn"></a>Release notes for XMvn</h2><section>
<h3><a name="What.27s_new_in_XMvn_4.0.0"></a>What's new in XMvn 4.0.0</h3>
<p>XMvn 4.0.0 was released on 2021-07-26. Most important changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Breaking changes
<ul>
<li>Gradle connector removed
<p>XMvn 4.0.0 drops connector for Gradle. It is no longer possible to use XMvn as a Gradle plugin for resolving and deploying artifacts from and to system repositories.</p></li>
<li>Ivy connector removed
<p>XMvn connector for Apache Ivy was moved to a separate project. XMvn itself is still able to resolve artifacts from Ivy repositories, but XMvn can't be used as Ivy resolver or publisher.</p></li>
<li>Bisect tool removed
<p>XMvn Bisect tool was removed. There is no replacement.</p></li>
<li>Artifact resolution from JAVA_HOME
<p>XMvn can no longer resolve artifacts from JAVA_HOME directory.</p></li>
<li>XMvn connector for Aether
<p>XMvn Connector for Aether was renamed back to XMvn Connector, following rename of Aether to Maven Resolver.</p></li>
<li>Java 11 runtime requirement
<p>XMvn now requires Java 11 to run. It can still be used to build projects with older Java versions by using Maven toolchains.</p></li></ul></li>
<li>New features
<ul>
<li>Plugin blacklisting
<p>XMvn 4.0.0 configuration allows blacklisting certain Maven plugins, which are removed from effective POM during build. This feature allows distributions to maintain list of not packaged, not useful plugins that don't need to be explicitly removed by each package.</p></li>
<li>XMvn toolchain manager
<p>XMvn 4.0.0 automatically activates Maven toolchain of type <b>jdk</b> which provides <b>xmvn=xmvn</b>. This feature allows to easily enable toolchains by system-wide configuration.</p></li></ul></li>
<li>Other changes
<ul>
<li>Duplicate metadata changes
<p>In case duplicated Javapackages metadata is found, XMvn will prefer entries which have namespace set, ignoring non-namespaced entries.</p></li></ul></li></ul></section><section>
<h3><a name="What.27s_new_in_XMvn_3.1.0"></a>What's new in XMvn 3.1.0</h3>
<p>XMvn 3.1.0 was released on 2019-06-14. Most important changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>API changes
<ul>
<li>Overriding compiler settings
<p>XMvn 3.1.0 no longer tries to override compiler source/target settings of Maven Compiler Plugin.</p></li></ul></li></ul></section><section>
<h3><a name="What.27s_new_in_XMvn_3.0.0"></a>What's new in XMvn 3.0.0</h3>
<p>XMvn 3.0.0 was released on 2017-06-20. Most important changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>API changes
<ul>
<li>New <code>Configurator</code> API
<p>XMvn 3.0.0 adds Configurator API service, which exposes XMvn configuration as Java beans.</p></li>
<li>New <code>MetadataResolver</code> API
<p>XMvn 3.0.0 adds new API service - <code>MetadataResolver</code>, which allows resolution of metadata for artifacts installed in the system.</p></li>
<li>Service locator API
<p>Instances of services provided by XMvn API can now be obtained using service locator, without using dependency injection. This change obsoleted XMvn Launcher module, which was removed in XMvn 3.0.0.</p></li>
<li>New default compiler source setting
<p>Since XMvn 3.0.0 <code>compilerSource</code> setting has a new default value equal to <code>1.6</code>.</p></li></ul></li>
<li>Changes in binary distribution
<ul>
<li>Launcher scripts removed from binary tarball
<p>Launcher scripts for tools, such as <code>xmvn-resolve</code>, <code>xmvn-install</code> etc., as well as <code>xmvn</code> launcher, were removed. From now on, tools can be ran using <code>java -jar</code> syntax and XMvn itself can be ran using standard <code>mvn</code> launcher. This is upstream change only - downstream distributions may continue to provide distro-specific launchers.</p></li>
<li>Ivy connector removed from binary tarball
<p>Since XMvn 3.0.0, connector for Apache Ivy is no longer included in binary tarball.</p></li></ul></li>
<li>New features
<ul>
<li>Ignoring duplicate metadata made configurable
<p>XMvn versions prior to 3.0.0 would previously always ignore installed artifacts, which have multiple metadata, for example when more than one package provides the same artifact. XMvn 3.0.0 added new option <code>ignoreDuplicateMetadata</code>, which can be used to control this behavior. <code>ignoreDuplicateMetadata</code> is <code>true</code> by default, but when set to <code>false</code> XMvn will resolve metadata for the first artifact found, ignoring others.</p></li>
<li>POM files for Tycho projects are not installed
<p>Projects built with Eclipse Tycho install JAR files in private locations specific to Eclipse, so POM files and metadata for them are not installed.</p></li>
<li>PoC implementation of Javadoc MOJO
<p>XMvn 3.0.0 added new MOJO, which can be used to generate API documentation (javadocs) as alternative to Maven Javadoc Plugin. Goal <code>xmvn-mojo:javadoc</code> works in similar way to <code>javadoc:aggregate</code>, but it has some advantages over it. XMvn javadoc makes javadocs more consistent between packages - it unifies javadoc options, doclet used, CSS styles, and so on. It opens possibilities for better integration with distributions in the future, like for example distro-specific themes, links or dependencies between javadoc packages. It also has much fewer dependencies, which means smaller builroots and faster builds.</p></li>
<li>More accurate builddep MOJO
<p>Builddep MOJO, which can be used for auto-generating build-requires, was rewritten almost from scratch. Now its output should be much more accurate.</p></li>
<li>Partial compatibility with Maven 3.0
<p>XMvn 3.0.0 restores partial compatibility with Maven 3.0.</p></li></ul></li>
<li>Bug fixes
<ul>
<li>Ignoring runtime exceptions during bytecode analysis
<p>Previously XMvn Installer would terminate abnormally on bytecode it couldn't parse, such as newer bytecode than recognized by ASM library which XMvn uses. This has been fixed in XMvn 3.0.0.</p></li>
<li>Coping with whitespaces in file names
<p>When installing files with whitespace in their names, XMvn Installer would previously generate incorrect file descriptor. XMvn 3.0.0 fixes this bug.</p></li></ul></li>
<li>Other changes
<ul>
<li>Release on Maven Central Repository
<p>Since 3.0.0 XMvn will be available in Maven Central Repository.</p></li>
<li>Migrated from fedorahosted.org to GitHub
<p>Since fedorahosted.org, the service that XMvn used to be hosted on, was decommissioned, XMvn source repository was moved to new home, which is now at GitHub: https://github.com/fedora-java/xmvn/</p></li></ul></li></ul></section><section>
<h3><a name="What.27s_new_in_XMvn_2.5.0"></a>What's new in XMvn 2.5.0</h3>
<p>XMvn 2.5.0 was released on 2015-10-28. Most important changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Major features
<ul>
<li>XMvn Gradle plugin
<p>XMvn Gradle plugin was implemented in version 2.5.0. When applied on a project, this plugin automatically configures repositories in local mode, so that project dependencies can be resolved from system repository. It also provides <code>xmvnInstall</code> task, which can be used to install artifacts produced by the build with XMvn Installer.</p></li>
<li>Custom buildroot option for XMvn Subst
<p>XMvn Subst now accepts a new option, <code>--root</code>, which specifies buildroot from which XMvn should resolve artifacts, in addition to standard locations. This option can be used for symlinking JARs produced during build. (Bug: 1226251)</p></li></ul></li>
<li>Major bugfixes
<ul>
<li>Builddep MOJO fixes
<p>Builddep MOJO was rewritten from scratch. The new code is more generic and supports many corner case in which the previous version produced incorrect results (bugs: 1217422, 1217425, 1217462, 1217473).</p></li></ul></li>
<li>Minor features
<ul>
<li>Warning when builddep MOJO is ran with pure Maven
<p>XMvn builddep MOJO 2.5.0 will print a warning when it's ran outsides of XMvn.</p></li>
<li>Allowing manifacs injection for invalid JAR files
<p>OpenJDK has a sanity check that prevents adding duplicate entries to ZIP streams. When trying to inject manifests to JAR files with duplicate entries XMvn would previously fail with &quot;ZipException: duplicate entry&quot;. XMvn 2.5.0 added a workaround that allows manifest injection to such invalid JAR files.</p></li></ul></li>
<li>Minor bugfixes
<ul>
<li>GradleResolver crash when resolving tools.jar
<p>XMvn 2.5.0 fixes a bug that caused Gradle resolver crash when trying to resolve tools.jar artifact.</p></li>
<li>Crash when effective POM generation failed
<p>XMvn 2.5.0 fixes a bug that caused crash with NullPointerException uppon failure to generate effective POM.</p></li>
<li>Slashes in effective POM names are replaced with dots
<p>XMvn versions prior to 2.5.0 would try to create effective POM files with artifactID as name, even if it contain slash character. XMvn 2.5.0 fixes this bug.</p></li></ul></li>
<li>Other changes
<p>XMvn 2.5.0 drops support for rarely-used compatibility configuration suffixes.</p></li></ul></section><section>

<h3><a name="What.27s_new_in_XMvn_2.0.1"></a>What's new in XMvn 2.0.1</h3>
<p>XMvn 2.0.1 was released on 2014-06-06. Most important changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minor features
<ul>
<li>Property to disable effective POMs
<p>XMvn 2.0.1 allows to globally disable generation and resolution of effective POMs by setting system property <code>xmvn.resolver.disableEffectivePom</code></p></li></ul></li>
<li>Minor bugfixes
<ul>
<li>Fixed JAR post-processing during installation
<p>In some cases XMvn 2.0.0 may have failed to inject Javapackages manifest entries to JARs it installs. It also failed to detect native code inside JARs. This was fixed in XMvn 2.0.1.</p></li>
<li>Fixed return code of <code>xmvn-install</code>
<p>XMvn Installer CLI used to return zero exit code even if installation failed. This was corrected in XMvn 2.0.1.</p></li>
<li>Implemented lazy loading of metadata
<p>XMvn spawns background threads to initialize some &quot;eager&quot; singletons in order to minimize delay on their first use and improve overall performance. Since Java allows isolated class realms to have multiple singleton instances, hundreds of initializer threads may have be spawned in applications heavily using isolated realms, such as in unit testing.</p>
<p>XMvn 2.0.1 implemented lazy initialization instead of eager initialization, which results in lower performance, but better worst-case behavior.</p></li>
<li>Fixed artifact resolution from local workspace repository
<p>XMvn 2.0.1 fixes a regression introduced in version 2.0.0 - artifacts were no longer resolved from local workspace repository (<code>$PWD/.m2</code>).</p></li></ul></li></ul></section><section>
<h3><a name="What.27s_new_in_XMvn_2.0.0"></a>What's new in XMvn 2.0.0</h3>
<p>XMvn 2.0.0 was released on 2014-05-29. Most important changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Major features
<ul>
<li>New metadata format
<p>XMvn 2.0.0 now reads and writes the new Javapackages metadata format instead of dependency maps. Read-only depmap support remains, but was deprecated.</p></li>
<li>Ivy integration
<p>Starting with version 2.0.0 XMvn provides a connector for Apache Ivy which enables Ivy or its clients to have access to XMvn resolver and deployer.</p>
<p>This feature enables Ant build scripts using Ivy tasks or other build systems that use Ivy to use local system artifact repository to resolve dependencies and more, making Ivy a first-class citizen among other build systems.</p></li>
<li>Artifact deployment
<p>Starting with version 2.0.0 XMvn provides an API to deploy artifacts to system repositories.</p></li>
<li>API separation
<p>XMvn 2.0.0 ships with a separate API module, which makes it more clear which parts of XMvn are part of public interface and which are considered as implementation details.</p></li>
<li>Class loader isolation
<p>XMvn 2.0.0 Core implementation is now using an isolated class loader to prevent unwanted classes from polluting Maven Core or user classpath.</p></li></ul></li>
<li>Minor features
<ul>
<li>Improved logging
<p>XMvn logging was ported from Plexus to SLF4J. This makes it possible to easily set different logging levels for different subsystems as well as use a custom backend.</p>
<p>Besides that some logging messages were improved and new ones were added.</p></li>
<li>Dependency version report
<p>At the end of a build XMvn can now print a dependency version report, which contains information about requested and resolved dependency artifact versions.</p></li>
<li>Improved Tycho integration
<p>XMvn 2.0.0 works better with Eclipse Tycho. In particular system-scoped OSGi dependencies injected by Tycho are now ignored and don't cause installation failures any longer.</p></li>
<li>Repository filtering
<p>XMvn 2.0.0 improves artifact filtering for installation repositories.</p></li></ul></li>
<li>Other changes
<ul>
<li>Migration to JSR-330
<p>Internal dependency injection mechanisms were migrated from Sisu Plexus to Sisu Inject, which provides JSR-330-compatible IoC mechanisms.</p></li>
<li>XMvn Connector rename
<p><code>xmvn-connector</code> module was renamed to <code>xmvn-connector-aether</code> to reflect addition of the new <code>xmvn-connector-ivy</code> module.</p></li>
<li>Removal of deprecated API
<p>Parts of XMvn API which were marked as deprecated were removed.</p></li>
<li>Namespace cleanup
<p>Java package names were renamed from <code>org.fedoraproject.maven</code> to <code>org.fedoraproject.xmvn</code>.</p></li>
<li>XMvn Installer rewrite
<p>XMvn Installer was rewritten from scratch in 2.0.0 and a new pluggable API was added.</p></li>
<li>Effective POM installation
<p>Effective POM's are no longer installed during package build. XMvn resolver is able to generate them on demand during package build from the new Javapackages metadata.</p></li></ul></li></ul></section><section>
<h3><a name="What.27s_new_in_XMvn_1.4.0"></a>What's new in XMvn 1.4.0</h3>
<p>XMvn 1.4.0 was released on 2013-12-09. Most important changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minor features
<ul>
<li>Limited support for absolute JPP artifact files
<p>Artifact files specified as absolute paths pointing to arbitrary locations are now allowed. They are implemented as symbolic links which are pointing to the primary artifact file, which must be explicitly specified as non-absolute file.</p>
<p>Appropriate suffixes are added depending on artifact version, classifier and extension. As absolute symlinks can be placed at any location, configured repositories are not taken into account and flat repository layout is always assumed.</p>
<p>Absolute symlinks are only created for artifact files and attached artifacts, but not for POM files. Absolute files for artifacts with no files (i.e. POM artifacts) are silently ignored.</p></li></ul></li>
<li>Minor bugfixes
<ul>
<li>Fix NullPointerException bug in installer code</li>
<li>Allow file installation in root directory
<p>XMvn was unable to install files in root directory because of false assumption that every directory has a parent. This was fixed in version 1.4.0.</p></li></ul></li></ul></section><section>
<h3><a name="What.27s_new_in_XMvn_1.3.0"></a>What's new in XMvn 1.3.0</h3>
<p>XMvn 1.3.0 was released on 2013-11-05. Most important changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Major features
<ul>
<li>Installation of Ivy modules
<p>Since version 1.3.0 XMvn can install Ivy modules. Ivy descriptor files are transparently converted to Maven POMs and installed as such. This feature is still experimental.</p></li></ul></li>
<li>Major bugfixes
<ul>
<li>Fix manifest injection
<p>XMvn no longer injects manifests to JAR files that have no manifests. This also fixes a bug that caused POM files to be replaced with empty JAR files in some cases.</p></li>
<li>Delay simplification of effective POMs
<p>Effective POMs are now simplified during package installation, not build. This way installer has enough information needed to generate auto-requires on Java version.</p></li>
<li>Make resolver ignore artifact types
<p>Configured artifact types by repositories no longer affect behaviour of XMvn resolver, but are still understood by installer.</p></li></ul></li>
<li>Minor bugfixes
<ul>
<li>Fix potential resource leaks
<p>XMvn 1.3.0 fixes a few bugs in which certain resources (mostly files) were not released (closed) even when they were no longer needed.</p></li></ul></li></ul></section><section>
<h3><a name="What.27s_new_in_XMvn_1.2.0"></a>What's new in XMvn 1.2.0</h3>
<p>XMvn 1.2.0 was released on 2013-10-18. Most important changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minor features
<ul>
<li>Artifact information in manifests
<p>Since version 1.2.0 XMvn injects artifact coordinates to manifests of artifact files it installs. XMvn Subst can read this information and use it to locate artifacts in the system. This way artifacts that do not contain pom.properties can still be correctly replaced with symbolic links by XMvn Subst.</p></li>
<li>Artifacts using native code
<p>Previous versions only tried to detect artifacts containing native code. In addition to that XMvn version 1.2.0 also attempts to detect JAR files using native code. This means that such JARs can be installed to a different location than JARs not containing and not using native code.</p></li></ul></li>
<li>Major bugfixes
<ul>
<li>Stereotype support in auto-requires
<p>XMvn Installer did not take into account artifact stereotypes. This caused generated auto-requires to be incorrect in some cases. This bug was partially fixed by embedding default Maven artifact type mappings. This means that any non-standard stereotypes may still be handled incorrectly and produce unsatisfiable dependencies.</p></li>
<li>Generated self-requires
<p>Auto-requires generator was corrected to generate correct auto-requires in complex cases involving compatibility versions, namespaces and dependencies on artifacts provided by the same package.</p></li></ul></li></ul></section><section>
<h3><a name="What.27s_new_in_XMvn_1.1.0"></a>What's new in XMvn 1.1.0</h3>
<p>XMvn 1.1.0 was released on 2013-09-30. Most important changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Major bugfixes
<ul>
<li>Dangling symlinks
<p>Version 1.1.0 fixes a bug that caused relative symbolic links creted by XMvn to be incorrect in many cases.</p></li></ul></li>
<li>Minor features
<ul>
<li>Improved debugging messages
<p>XMvn 1.1.0 tries to better describe reasons of build failure. Some new logging messages were introduced. New useful data was added to some other messages. Effective packaging rules are printed even for skipped artifacts.</p></li>
<li>Strict mode of XMvn Subst
<p>XMvn Subst 1.1.0 introduced a new option -- strict mode. In this mode XMvn Subst will fail if there are any artifacts that were unable to replace with symbolic links.</p></li>
<li>Dry run mode of XMvn Subst
<p>XMvn Subst 1.1.0 supports dru run. In this mode it will fail not replace any artifacts, but report what would be normally done.</p></li>
<li>Skipped artifacts
<p>Metadata generated by XMvn 1.1.0 and later versions includes information about artifacts which were part of Maven reactor, but were not installed. This information will be used by Java Packages Tools for performing better sanity checks on built packages.</p></li>
<li>Compressed metadata files
<p>XMvn 1.1.0 can read metadata files compressed with GNU zip. For bigger files this will allow them to be stored entirely in i-nodes and therefore improve performance and decrease disk usage.</p></li></ul></li></ul></section><section>
<h3><a name="What.27s_new_in_XMvn_1.0.2"></a>What's new in XMvn 1.0.2</h3>
<p>XMvn 1.0.2 was released on 2013-09-20. Most important changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Major bugfixes
<ul>
<li>Missing requires on parent POM artifacts
<p>Version 1.0.0 introduced a regression -- automatic dependencies on parent POM packages were no longer generated. Version 1.0.2 fixes this regression.</p></li></ul></li>
<li>Minor bugfixes
<ul>
<li>Missing sanity checks for missing models
<p>In version 1.0.2 more strict sanity checks were added for cases when artifacts were installed with missing model (POM) files.</p></li></ul></li></ul></section><section>
<h3><a name="What.27s_new_in_XMvn_1.0.0"></a>What's new in XMvn 1.0.0</h3>
<p>XMvn 1.0.0 was released on 2013-09-09. Most important changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Major features
<ul>
<li>Flexible repositories
<p>Since version 1.0.0 XMvn has a new way of configuring repositories from which artifacts are resolved and to which they are installed. Several aspects of artifact resolution which were hardcoded in previous versions of XMvn are configurable since version 1.0.0.</p></li>
<li>Classifiers and extensions
<p>Previous versions of XMvn lacked support for artifact classifiers and for artifact extensions other than <code>jar</code> and <code>pom</code>. Since version 1.0.0 XMvn supports resolution and installation of artifacts with any classifier and extension.</p></li>
<li>Compatibility versions
<p>Although previous versions were able to resolve versioned artifacts (also knows as compatibility versions), there was no support for installing versioned artifacts. Since version 1.0.0 XMvn fully supports compatibility versions -- it is able to both resolve and install versioned artifacts.</p></li>
<li>Installing artifacts not produced in reactor
<p>Sometimes there is a need to install artifacts not produced in Maven reactor, but generated by other means, like custom script or other build system. Since version 1.0.0 XMvn allows installation of such artifacts along with artifacts produced by Maven build.</p></li>
<li>Artifact namespaces
<p>XMvn 1.0.0 allows artifacts to have namespaces, which limits possible name clashes and allows several versions of the same artifact to be installed more easily without the need to use compatibility versions. This feature can be used to implement support for software collections.</p></li></ul></li>
<li>Minor features
<ul>
<li>Improved performance of resolver
<p>Reading depmap fragments is the dominant operation when running short-living tools like XMvn Resolve or XMvn Subst. Since version 1.0.0 depmaps are being read in parallel, which improves performance on multi-processor systems.</p></li>
<li>Improved build-requires generator
<p>Dependency did not include all possible cases when generating build-requires. This has been improved in XMvn 1.0.0.</p></li>
<li>Improved support for compatibility versions
<p>Versioned artifacts are now resolved in simpler and more obvious way.</p></li>
<li>Improved handling of Java versions
<p>Besides standard versions like 1.4 or 1.7 XMvn now recognizes other visioning schemes like 7.0 or 7, as well as <code>jsr14</code> and <code>cldc1.1</code>.</p></li>
<li>Improved error handling in command-line tools
<p>Command like tools now print better error messages and are less likely to print stack traces for user errors.</p></li></ul></li>
<li>Minor bugfixes
<ul>
<li>Possible concurrency bug when creating symbolic links
<p>Possible concurrency bug when creating symbolic links was avoided by using file system atomic operations, if supported by file system.</p></li></ul></li></ul></section><section>
<h3><a name="What.27s_new_in_XMvn_0.5.0"></a>What's new in XMvn 0.5.0</h3>
<p>XMvn 0.5.0 was released on 2013-05-24. Most important changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Major features
<ul>
<li>XMvn Subst
<p>Version 0.5.0 brings a new tool - XMvn Subst. This tool is able to replace individual artifact files with symbolic links to corresponding files in system artifact repository. It is also able to recursively process whole directories.</p></li>
<li>XMvn Bisect
<p>Since version 0.5.0 a new tool - XMvn Bisect - is available. This tool helps automating debugging build failures using bisection method. It first builds project using dependencies coming from system repository only, next only from remote repositories, then halves dependency set recursively until it finds differences which are causing build failure.</p></li></ul></li>
<li>Minor features
<ul>
<li>Basic support for dependency version ranges
<p>In previous versions XMvn did not support dependency version ranges. If range was used in POM then Maven would try to resolve all available versions from remote repository and pick the best match.</p>
<p>Starting from XMvn 0.5.0 any dependency version ranges without recommended version specified are replaced with version <code>SYSTEM</code>, which means default artifact version in the system. This prevents Maven from trying to use remote repositories.</p></li>
<li>Improved configuration loading
<p>Starting from version 0.5.0 configuration is read only once at the beginning of the build. In previous versions configuration was read every time it was needed. The new approach is not only faster, but also allows configuration to be modified by plugins during runtime.</p></li>
<li>Better handling of inaccurate configuration
<p>In previous versions any packaging rules that didn't match any artifact in the reactor were silently ignored. Since version 0.5.0 any non-optional packaging rule that is not used causes the build to fail.</p></li></ul></li>
<li>Minor bugfixes
<ul>
<li>Incorrect path to JPP artifacts
<p>Paths to JPP artifacts containing more than one slash in groupId were generated incorrectly. This could cause dependency resolution failures in some rare cases. This bug was fixed in version 0.5.0.</p></li>
<li>Fixed exit code of XMvn Resolve
<p>Now <code>xmvn-resolve</code> returns 0 when it successfully resolves all artifacts, 1 on failure to resolve one or more artifacts and 2 when some other error occurs. In the last case a stack trace is printed too.</p></li>
<li>Fixed installation of artifact marked as not installable
<p>Before version 0.5.0 XMvn tried to find installers for all artifacts in the reactor, even for those marked as not installable. As a result reactors that contained artifacts with unsupported packaging types failed to build, even if instalation of these artifacts was explicitly skipped.</p>
<p>This bug was fixed in XMvn 0.5.0, in which artifact packaging type has to be supported only if the artifact is installable.</p></li></ul></li></ul></section><section>
<h3><a name="What.27s_new_in_XMvn_0.4.2"></a>What's new in XMvn 0.4.2</h3>
<p>XMvn 0.4.2 was released on 2013-04-09. Most important changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minor bugfixes
<ul>
<li>Empty fields in artifact aliases
<p>Version 0.4.0 introduced a regression - empty fields in artifact aliases were not replaced by corresponding fields from the main artifact. This bug was fixed in version 0.4.2.</p></li></ul></li></ul></section><section>
<h3><a name="What.27s_new_in_XMvn_0.4.1"></a>What's new in XMvn 0.4.1</h3>
<p>XMvn 0.4.1 was released on 2013-03-21. Most important changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minor bugfixes
<ul>
<li>Read configuration files in sorted order
<p>In previous versions configuration files were read in in the system default order. This was causing unpredictable results in cases where the order of configuration did matter.</p></li>
<li>Correctly handle conflicts between explicit packaging rules and implicit singleton packaging rule
<p>Previously it was unspecified which of rules would take precedence. Since version 0.4.1 the first rule encountered will be used.</p></li>
<li>Don't set scope of optional compile dependencies to <i>provided</i>
<p>The code that was setting scope of optional dependencies to <i>provided</i> was removed. This code was meant to be used for testing only and it was never supposed to make into a stable release.</p></li></ul></li></ul></section><section>
<h3><a name="What.27s_new_in_XMvn_0.4.0"></a>What's new in XMvn 0.4.0</h3>
<p>XMvn 0.4.0 was released on 2013-03-15. Most important changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Major features
<ul>
<li>Improved configuration
<p>Starting from version 0.4.0 XMvn is configured using XML configuration files instead of environmental variables. The configuration model was built using Modello and it's fully documented. The XML model supports new configuration options, it's more flexible and has new features, such as inheritance of different configuration files.</p></li>
<li>Improved bootstrapping
<p>Prior to version 0.4.0 XMvn used to be bootstrapped using a custom launcher code. In version 0.4.0 XMvn Launcher module was dropped and bootstrapping process was migrated to standard Classworlds launcher. Now the bootstrap process can be controlled with standard <code>m2.conf</code> file.</p></li>
<li>New site
<p>Now XMvn site is created from XMvn POM using Maven Site Plugin. It contains much more detailed information about the project, including release notes, Javadocs, source cross-reference and much more.</p></li></ul></li>
<li>Major bugfixes
<ul>
<li>XMvn installation now uses standard Maven directory layout, which improves integration with other Maven components and fixes problems with Maven Invoker.</li></ul></li>
<li>Minor features
<ul>
<li>Improved support for Fedora Software Collections</li>
<li>Enhanced artifact blacklist</li>
<li>Improved logging</li>
<li>Added m2eclipse configuration to POM</li>
<li>Javadocs use API diagrams generated with Graphviz</li></ul></li>
